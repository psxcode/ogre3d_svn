Removed Mesh::getLodIndexSquaredDepth.
Mesh::getLodIndex now requires a squared distances when using DistanceLodStrategy.
Mesh::generateLodLevels and Mesh::createManualLodLevel also require squared distances when using DistanceLodStrategy.
Renamed MeshLodUsage::fromDepthSquared to value.
Renamed LodDistanceList to LodValueList and LodDistanceIterator to LodValueIterator.
Material::getLodIndex and Material::setLodLevels now require squared distances when using DistanceLodStrategy.
Renamed Material::mLodDistances to mLodValues.
Renamed Material::getLodDistanceIterator to getLodValueIterator
Removed Material::getLodIndexSquaredDepth as it no longer applies.
Renamed Entity::_getMeshLodFactorInverse to Entity::_getMeshLodFactorTransformed as this method does not neccessarily return the inverse anymore (but will when using DistanceLodStrategy).
Renamed InstancedGeometry::BatchInstance::mCamDistanceSquared to mLodValue.
