Removed Mesh::getLodIndexSquaredDepth.
Mesh::getLodIndex now requires a squared distances when using DistanceLodStrategy.
Renamed MeshLodUsage::fromDepthSquared to value.
Renamed LodDistanceList to LodValueList and LodDistanceIterator to LodValueIterator.
Material::getLodIndex now requires squared distances when using DistanceLodStrategy.
Renamed Material::mLodDistances to mLodValues.
Renamed Material::getLodDistanceIterator to getLodValueIterator
Removed Material::getLodIndexSquaredDepth as it no longer applies.
Renamed Entity::_getMeshLodFactorInverse to Entity::_getMeshLodFactorTransformed as this method does not neccessarily return the inverse anymore (but will when using DistanceLodStrategy).
Renamed InstancedGeometry::BatchInstance::mCamDistanceSquared to mLodValue.
Renamed InstancedGeometry::LODBucket::mSquaredDistance to mLodValue.
Renamed InstancedGeomety::LODBucket::getSquaredDistance to getLodValue.
Renamed StaticGeometry::Region::mCamDistanceSquared to mLodValue.
Renamed StaticGeomety::LODBucket::mSquaredDistance to mLodValue.
Renamed StaticGeomety::LODBucket::getSquaredDistance to getLodValue.
Added LodStrategy argument to MeshSerializerImpl::writeLodSummary.
